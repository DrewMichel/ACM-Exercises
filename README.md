# ACM-Exercises
Comments will be absent from the majority of the ACM projects in an attempt to prepare for the event's time limit.
Several projects may be incomplete or abandoned.  Some projects may work as intended except for extreme inputs.
Each ACM year source folder will contain that year's project handout in pdf.
As of writing, the ACM time limit is five hours with ten projects.
